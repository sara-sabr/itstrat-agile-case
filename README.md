This is a repo to organize the IT Strategy's Business Case for an ESDC Agile Governance Framework. A separate repo than the main "ITStrategy" one was created so that we can organize its milestones and progression separately from the ITStrategy repo (GitHub can't lists milestones by project, it lists all milestones in a given repo).
